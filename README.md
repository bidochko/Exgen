Exgen is a tool for procedurally generating Computer Science & Mathematics exam papers.
The general idea is that you'll write a question with variables instead of numbers, such as "What is X + Y?".

You will then write code to solve this (our code has a lot of solutions, but it might be easier for you to write your own).
Our program will then insert random values and will use the code you've written to generate new exam papers.

The idea is that you write one example, but your students can get hundreds of examples of the same question.
