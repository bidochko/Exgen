Design List
=======
# Things to design
## architecture of the system (what sub-systems we want in our system)
* what databases we need
* what sub-systems we need
    * question input
    * question displaying
    * front end 
    * security 
    * login 
    * etc.
* which sub-system communicate with what 
## Abstract specification
* describing each sub-system 
* stuff like class diagrams
## interface design (how sub-systems communicate)
* what information needs to be passed around
* how much information is passed (minimise for performance)
* have as few interfaces as possible
* information hiding, so no other sub-system should be able to access unneeded information
* will probably have to do a system model like a Petri net or Moore machine
## Data structure design
* what data should we store (can't store excessive amounts of data, "unethical")
* how it should be stored (sorted, unsorted, relational, etc.)
* best ways to access/query the data
## Algorithm design
* method designs (if we are using object oriented)
* function/subroutine designs
## presentation
