We need 3 classes.

One class to read and interpret the file (will be more useful when the file is LaTeX)

One class to generate the questions and insert it into the new LaTeX document (I think this can be broken down more... One class for the code given by user, one class for our code. Maybe our code can be abstract and we instansiate a new object with their code....? something like that ðŸ˜•)

One class to generate the new PDF document from LaTeX (this will be more useful if we create a web app)

# Later on

Web app somehow (maybe Flask & Python ?)
